# Deployment Strategies

There are different ways to use The C19 Protocol. As you may have seen in the [Use cases] chapter, deployment of the C19 protocol 
is dependent on your use-case.

The most classic deployment strategy and where the C19 shines against other alternatives is to have it deployed alongside your application 
and let it bring the data you need locally to your application.

But since the C19 protocol is a general purpose, distributed shared state, it can be deployed and used in many other ways. Let's briefly go 
through different deployment strategies to spark up your imagination. You are free to experiment with different deployment strategies and use cases.

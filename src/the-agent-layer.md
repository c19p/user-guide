# The Agent Layer

The `Agent` is the entry-point to your application. An `Agent` exposes ways for your application to get and set values to and from the `State`.

Different agents can use different ways to expose your application to get and set values. We will explore the implementation of 
the `Default` agent layer as an example.

Please refer to [Appendix I / Available Agents] to learn about available agents to choose from.

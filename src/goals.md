# Goals

Here we define the goals of the project. Our vision is to be able to have a general-purpose, easily extensible system that can answer most use-cases when 
it comes to distributed state sharing.

1. **Simplicity**. There is no magic. The project should be easy to reason-about. Every user of the project should have a clear grasp of 
   how it works and where it might break.
2. **Just work**. To be able to go live in a matter of minutes. The tooling around the project should be easy and deployment should be reachable.
3. **Extensible**. The project must be simple to extend and support a wide variety of use-cases.
4. **Kubernetes**. Due to Kubernetes nature and reach, the project should allow for fast, simple and easy work with a Kubernetes cluster.
5. **Documentation**. The project should be well documented. Both for users who wish to use the C19 protocol and for those who wish to contribute and 
   extend it.

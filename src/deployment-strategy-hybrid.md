# A Hybrid Deployment

![Deployment Strategy / Hybrid][figure]

You are not bounded to a single deployment strategy. If your use case justifies it, you may combine 
different deployment strategies together. A hybrid solution.

Consider a case where you have the classic deployment strategy where the C19 agents are attached to your services.
You then want a standalone deployment that will be part of the same C19 group as with 
your services, and act as a gateway to the shared state.

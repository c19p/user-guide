# Getting Started

This chapter will guide you through configuring and deploying a C19 cluster.

As you will learn, the C19 protocol can support different deployment strategies and different configurations. In this chapter we will focus on the most common one 
so you can get an idea of how things work. Later in the book you will learn about the different options this project presents.
